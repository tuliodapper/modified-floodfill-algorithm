# modified-floodfill-algorithm

This MATLAB script was written in order to validate the Flood Fill algorithm that was modified and developed for solving the maze problem. After the test was performed, the algorithm was implemented in C code for using in the Icarus project (https://github.com/tuliodapper/icarus). Use MATLAB R2015a or later versions.
